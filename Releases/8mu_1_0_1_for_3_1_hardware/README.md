## 1.0.1 Firmware for Beta 3.1 Hardware 

Hi, if you were a Beta tester, thank you. 

The firmware changed after 3.1 to fix the hardware midi port, meaning that various pin assignments changed. 

This version of the uf2 file has been compiled to work with the 3.1 hardware - let me know if you see any wierdness. 

Midi A / B will still not work with this firmware, it's stuck in Version B (from memory)
